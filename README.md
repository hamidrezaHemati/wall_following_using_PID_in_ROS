# wall_following_using_PID_in_ROS
This project involves the development of a wall-following mobile robot using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The robot is simulated in the ROS (Robot Operating System) environment, utilizing Gazebo and RViz simulators for a comprehensive and realistic simulation.
